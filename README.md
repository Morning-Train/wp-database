## Introduction

## Getting Started

To get started install the package as described below in [Installation](#installation).

To use the tool have a look at [Usage](#usage)

### Installation

Install with composer

```bash
composer require morningtrain/wp-database
```

## Dependencies

### illuminate/database

[Database](https://laravel.com/docs/database)

## Usage

### Initializing package

```php
<?php
    Database::setup(__DIR__ . "/database/migrations");
```

If you want to use migrations from multiple directories you can do, by calling the setup method multiple times.

### Creating a Model

In `app/Models`

```php
// Foo.php
<?php

    namespace MyProject\App\Models;

    /**
     * @property int $id
     * @property string $title
     */
    class Foo extends \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model
    {
        public $timestamps = false;
        protected $table = 'foo';
    }
```

### Creating a Migration

```shell
wp make:migration create_foo_table
```

If there is multiple migration paths, you will be asked to choose one.  
Will create a new migration file for you with `Schema::create('foo')` already prepared.

### Running migrations

You can run all new migrations like so:

Using `wp cli`:

```shell
wp dbmigrate
```

Using `php`:

```php
<?php
    \Morningtrain\WP\Database\Database::migrate();
?>
```
